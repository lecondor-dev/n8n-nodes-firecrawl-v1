[Documentation](/introduction) [SDKs](/sdks/overview) [Learn](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/category/tutorials) [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction)

Firecrawl converts web pages into markdown, ideal for LLM applications.

- It manages complexities: proxies, caching, rate limits, js-blocked content
- Handles dynamic content: dynamic websites, js-rendered sites, PDFs, images
- Outputs clean markdown, structured data, screenshots or html.

### [â€‹](\#extract-object)  Extract object\
\

- `prompt`: The prompt to use for the extraction without a schema.\
\
## [â€‹](\#interacting-with-the-page-with-actions)  Interacting with the page with Actions\
\
Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.\
\
Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.\
\
It is important to almost always use the `wait` action before/after executing other actions to give enough time for the page to load.\
\
### [â€‹](\#example)  Example\
\
Python\
\
Node\
\
cURL\
\
Copy\
\
```python\
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp\

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")\
\
# Scrape a website:\
scrape_result = app.scrape_url('firecrawl.dev',\
    params={\
        'formats': ['markdown', 'html'],\
        'actions': [\
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\
            {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},\
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\
            {"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},\
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\
            {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},\
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},\
            {"type": "click", "selector": "h3"},\
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},\
            {"type": "screenshot"}\
        ]\
    }\
